## Objective
We are a group of 4 students from Wild Code School Web Development bootcamp and our task was to create a fully functional React app by using API calls, functional and class components, npm packages and many more. 
The time allocated for this project was around 2 months.
We have chosen to create a job platform because we wanted to do something meaningful that could potentially help us and other people around us.
